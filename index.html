            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development. Educational methods
                include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes
                place under the guidance of educators; however, learners can also educate themselves.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Aztecs had schools for the noble youths called Calmecac where they
                would receive rigorous religious and military training. The Aztecs also had a well-developed theory
                about education, which has an equivalent word in Nahuatl called tlacahuapahualiztli. It means "the art
                of raising or educating a person", or "the art of strengthening or bringing up men".
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations
                and advancing technology in factories, which required skilled workers. In order to meet this new job
                demand, high schools were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better
                prepare students for white collar or skilled blue collar work.
